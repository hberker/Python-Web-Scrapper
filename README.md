This is a basic web scraper created in python

It has three functions(so far)
    1. scrap a certain amount of websites for the appearances of words
    2. scrap simplycollege.com for information about colleges based of an ACT score
    3. scrap websites until a certain amount of data is gathered

TODO:
    1. Better word processing in order to be able to analys text
    2. More scrapping options
